White Slavery refers to this phenomenon of trafficking young females. In 1905 Alexandria, women migrated to the area, often working in places like music halls .  The influx of women led to increased power of the White Slave Trade. Such popularity of White Slaves further contributed to the anxiety surrounding the safety of young, mainly single women is the trend of murder in Egypt. According to data from a previous blog post, most of the murder was completed by the same demographic that consumed sex services: men.


The National Vigilance Association formed in response to the influx of sex trafficking in English Colonies. As seen in Egyptian National Gazette news coverage, this organization peaked interest in the eyes of the English-speaking colonial readers. In contrast to the many marriage announcements seen in the Egyptian Gazette, coverage of the National Vigilance Association represented a dark spot on the social record of Egypt. That is, the National Vigilance Association normalized discussion over socially reprehensible acts.


National Vigilance Association fought sexual violence through a lens of maintaining safety of women in Egypt by ending the White Slave Trade. Such a relationship is seen through marriage announcements on the Egyptian Gazette. National Vigilance Association represents a distinctly modern way of fighting the dangers of abuse.
